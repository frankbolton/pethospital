<h1>Welcome to the study</h1>
<h2> Some Task Particulars. </h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px">The objective of this study is to better understand human factors of intelligent notification systems in the context of performing a process management task.
</p>
<h3>Action Required</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px">
The cat health levels tend to decrease over time, and sometimes a mobile phone message will give a warning about a problem with one of the stations.<br>
You will view cat health levels, and heal the cat's as you think it's necessary. <br>
Viewing and healing the cats cost you some score. <br>
Your objective is to keep all of the health levels above 0%.<br>
<b><i>need to include mobile phone interaction instructions</i></b>
</p>

<h3>Study particulars</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px">There is a {{learntime}} minute training block where the score will be visible all of the time, to show you how the health and score of the system behave.<br>
The study will consist of {{numberOfSessions}} tasks of {{exptime}} minutes each.<br> After each task you have a chance to answer a few questions about your experience.<br>
This makes for a task time of about {{totalTime}} minutes.</p>

<h3>Benefits and possible risks</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px">
The main personal benefit from your participation is the payment you will receive for participation.
A performance bonus will be issued to one player and the chances of winning are based on your score.<br>
Apart from that, the knowledge received may be of value to humanity and hopefully the development of further mobile phone notification mechanisms. <br> You will be performing a process management task that is quite demanding. You may experience tiredness at the end of the study, but no parts of the exam are harmful.
</p>
