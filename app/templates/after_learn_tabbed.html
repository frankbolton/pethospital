There's a little more to do here than in the training block.

In addition to managing the pets, you will have to deal with incoming text messages on a virtual smart watch.</p>

<p>The current screen has two buttons on top that allow you to switch between the attending to the pet hospital or the smartwatch. <br>
Audible notifications will be made when you have recieved messages, so please put on your headphones.
