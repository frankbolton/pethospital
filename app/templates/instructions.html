<h3>You will perform an experiment consisting of</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px">
<ul>
<li>One {{learntime}} minute training block <br>
<li>{{numberOfSessions}} recorded sessions of {{exptime}} minutes each</p></ul>


<h3>Training Block</h3>
<ol><li>Your objective in the experiment is to try maximize your score, this will be shown periodically on the top left hand corner of the screen.<br>
<img src="static/training_block_score_arrow.gif" alt="arrow showing the score" height="150" ><br>
    
    <li>To increase your score, you need to keep all of the health measures for the pets above 0%.
The pets' health levels gradually decrease and need "Heal" interventions from time to time.<br>
    <img src="static/healthpositive.gif" alt="arrow showing the score" height="150" ><br>
"Healing" costs you score, so don't press the heal button too frequently..<br>
   The second condition to the score increasing is that the pet health levels are hidden.
   The pet is automatically hidden when the "heal" button is pressed.
