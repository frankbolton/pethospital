<h1>Instructions to perform the study</h1>
<p style="font-size:18px">
Your objective is to apply yourself to maximize your score in each session. The higher your score- the greater your odds of winning a $5 bonus!

<h3>Method</h3>

The pet health levels decrease over time.<br>
Topping up the health is done by pressing the heal "button" - don't do it excessively as it's costly to your score.<br></p>
