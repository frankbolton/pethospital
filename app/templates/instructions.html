<h3>You will perform an experiment consisting of</h3>

<ul>
<li>One {{learntime}} minute training block <br>
<li>{{numberOfSessions}} recorded sessions of {{exptime}} minutes each</p></ul>

1 Your objective in the experiment is to try maximize your score, this will be shown periodically on the top left hand corner of the screen.<br>

    2 To increase your score, you need to keep all of the health measures for the pets above 0% by performing a periodic "healing" action, this tops up the inputs that the pet needs to recover from it's illness.<br>

"Healing" costs you score, so don't press the heal button too frequently..<br>
   The second condition to the score increasing is that the pet health levels are hidden.
   The pet is automatically hidden when the "heal" button is pressed.
