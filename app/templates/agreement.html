<h1>Welcome to the multi-device HCI study:</h1>
<h2> Some Task Particulars. </h2>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px">The objectives of this study are to understand better human factors of intelligent notification systems in the context of performing a process management task.
</p>
<h3>Action Required</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px">
The cat health levels tend to decrease over time, and sometimes a mobile phone message will give a warning about a problem with one of the stations.<br>
You will look inside the station when you think it's necessary, and healing the station costs me some score. <br>
Your objective is to keep all of the health levels above 0%.
</p>

<h3>Study particulars</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px">There is a 5 minute training block where the score will be visible all of the time, to show you how the health and score of the system behave.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">The study will consist of 3 tasks of 5 minutes each. After each task you have a chance to answer a few questions about your experience.
This makes for an task time of about 25 minutes.</p>

<h3>Benefits and possible risks</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px">
The main personal benefit from your participation is the payment I will receive for participation.
A performance bonus will be issued to one player and the chances of winning are based on your score.<br>
Apart from that, the knowledge received may be of value to humanity and hopefully the development of further mobile phone notification mechanisms. You will be performing a process management task that is quite demanding. You may experience tiredness at the end of the study, but no parts of the exam are harmful.
</p>




<h3>Rights</h3>
<p style="font-size:18px">You are free to not participate in the study, or to leave the study at any time, without any harm, damages to my rights, and without any sanction carried out against you.<br>
Your personal privacy is protected in scientific publications.<br>
Your questions regarding the study will be promptly answered by Frank Bolton, <a href="mailto:frankjbolton@gmail.com">frankjbolton@gmail.com</a></p>
