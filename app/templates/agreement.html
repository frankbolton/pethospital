<ul>
<li>I agree that I am willing to participate in the study titled "multi-device HCI study".</li>
<li>I confirm that I am 18 years old or older.</li></ul>


<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>My objective is to apply myself to try maximise the score in each session. <br>
The experiment objectives are to understand better human factors of intelligent notification systems in the context of performing a process management task.
</p>
<h3>Method</h3>
I will try to maximise the score, the score increases when all of the pet stations have a positive heath level. <br>
The pet health levels tend to decrease over time, and sometimes a mobile phone message will give a warning about a problem with one of the stations.<br>
Looking inside the station, and healing the station costs me some score. <br>
I will try to learn the behaviour, to keep all the stations healthy, without looking and healing too often.
<h3>Experiment particulars</h3>
The experiment will consist of 5 tasks of 5 minutes each. After each task you have a chance to answer a few questions about your experience.
This makes for an allocated experiment time of 30 minutes.<br>

<h3>Benefits and possible risks</h3>
<p>
The main personal benefit from your participation is the payment I will receive for participation.
A performance bonus will be issued to one player and the chances of winning are based on your score.<br>
Apart from that, the knowledge received may be of value to humanity and hopefully the development of further mobile phone notification mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
You will be performing a process management task that is quite demanding. You may experience tiredness at the end of the experiment, but no parts of the exam are harmful.
</p>




<h3>Rights</h3>
<p>I am free not to participate in the experiment, or to leave the experiment at any time, without any harm, damages to my rights, and without any sanction carried out against me.<br>
My personal privacy is protected in scientific publications.<br>
My questions regarding the study will be promptly answered by Frank Bolton, <a href="mailto:frankjbolton@gmail.com">frankjbolton@gmail.com</a></p>
