<h1>Welcome to the Pet Hospital Study</h1>
<div id="centered">
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>The objective of this study is to better understand human factors of intelligent notification systems in the context of performing a process management task.
</p>
<h3>Benefits and possible risks</h3>
<p>
The main personal benefit from your participation is the payment you will receive for participation.
You will receive a basic amount of {{basicPay}} and a bonus of {{bonusPay}} based on how well you perform the task. <p>
Apart from that, the knowledge received may be of value to humanity and hopefully the development of further mobile phone notification mechanisms. <br> You will be performing a process management task that is quite demanding. You may experience tiredness at the end of the study, but no parts of the exam are harmful.
